<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Intellectual is an alternative frontend for [Genius](https://genius.com/) focused on privacy and simplicity.  
Written in Rust, Intellectual is incredibly lightweight.
Not requiring JavaScript and proxying all requests through the server, including images.

Intellectual is still very early in development and is lacking many features.  
Check out the [roadmap](#roadmap) for what features will be coming next!

If there is a checkmark under "Cloudflare", that means the site
is proxied behind [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).  
This means they have the ability to monitor traffic between you and the server.

<!-- DEPLOYMENT -->

## Deployment

### Deploying

#### Docker

The easiest way to host intellectual is via Docker, and the included Docker Compose file.
To create a new directory, download the `docker-compose.yml`, and cd into the directory, run the following command (Requires cURL 7.10.3 or newer)
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Insprill/intellectual/master/docker-compose.yml --create-dirs -o intellectual/docker-compose.yml && cd intellectual
```
By default, it'll bind to `127.0.0.1:8080`.
Once you're satisfied with the container, you can start it with
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### Native

If you don't want to use Docker, you can download the latest [stable](https://github.com/Insprill/intellectual/releases) or [nightly](https://nightly.link/Insprill/intellectual/workflows/rust/master) build from GitHub actions. Make sure to choose the version for your target operating system.

Append the `-h` flag when running to see all available arguments.

### TLS

Intellectual supports TLS connections natively using [rustls][rustls-repo].
To enable TLS, provide the `--tls` flag, followed by `--tls-key-file` and `--tls-cert-file` pointing to their respective files on disk.
